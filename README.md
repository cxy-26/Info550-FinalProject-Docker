Please change to a work directory you want to run this project.

The image can be built by running the command below:

``` terminal

make cxy26/final
```

Link to the image on Dockerhub:

<https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cxy26/final>

Procedures to automatically generate the report using docker:

Please run the command below in terminal

``` terminal

make report/report.html
```

This will create a folder in your work directory called report and it
contains the report.html file. The whole process will take about 20
minutes since building the container and installing all the packages are
really time-consuming.

Please run the command below in terminal to synchronize the package
repository.

``` terminal
make install
```

The final report is generated by makefile rules and corresponding R
scripts.

Please run the command below in terminal to generate the report
automatically.

``` terminal
make report.html
```

The report contains the 6 tables and 2 plots and corresponding
descriptions.

All the tables are generated by code/tables.R and all the plots are
generated by code/plots.R

The whole process will take a while because of the large data set.
